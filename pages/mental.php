                                self-worth and confidence. <span class="highlighted-text">For students,</span>
                                depression may arise from academic pressure,
                                uncertainty about the future, or social struggles. RTT helps students shift their

                                rewiring negative thought patterns and cultivating self-empowerment, which leads to
                                greater inner peace. For Students, anxiety is commonly tied to exam stress, peer
