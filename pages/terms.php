                        <strong>Scope – What does this Policy cover?</strong><br>
                        2.1 These Terms and Conditions do not exclude or limit liability for death or personal injury
                        resulting from negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that may not be
                        lawfully limited or excluded under applicable law.<br>
                        2.2 Subject to Section 2.1 above:<br>
                        2.2.1 While Servet Ege will make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of information on the
                        site, no representation or warranty, whether express or implied, statutory, or otherwise, is

                        all indemnities, warranties, terms, and conditions (whether express or implied) are excluded to
                        the maximum extent permitted under applicable law.<br>
                        2.2.2 Kindly be aware that the information provided on these pages, as well as our services and
                        products, is not a substitute for qualified medical advice. It does not replace the guidance of
                        your doctor or qualified physician, nor does it endorse the treatment of illnesses by
                        individuals who are not duly qualified. If you think you have or may have a medical condition of
                        any kind then you should seek the appropriate support and only use our services and products
                        with the informed consent and guidance of your doctor.<br>
                        2.2.3 If you are using hypnosis and are currently under medical care for ANY condition, refrain
                        from making any adjustments to ANY prescribed medication without the explicit approval of your
                        doctor. If uncertain, it is advisable to seek advice from your GP.<br>
                        Please exercise caution: Individuals diagnosed with epilepsy are generally advised against

                        2.2.5 As the majority of our products involve hypnosis or altered states of consciousness, you
                        should not use them while driving, operating machinery, or engaging in any activity that demands
                        your full attention<br>
                        2.2.6 Servet Ege shall not be held liable, whether in contract, tort (including, but not limited
                        to, negligence), pre-contract, or other representations (except for fraudulent or negligent
                        misrepresentations), or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with these Terms and
                        Conditions for any<br>
                        a. Economic losses (including, but not limited to, loss of revenues, data, profits, contracts,
                        business, or anticipated savings);<br>

                        c. Special or indirect losses; or<br>
                        d. other losses suffered or incurred by that party, arising out of or in connection with the
                        provisions of any matter under these Terms and Conditions.<br>
                        2.2.7 Notwithstanding the above, Servet Ege’s total liability (whether in contract, tort, or
                        otherwise) for loss or damage shall, in any event, be limited to the amount paid or payable by
                        you for the product(s) and/or services related to one incident or series of incidents
                        attributable to the same clause, whichever is greater.<br>
                        2.2.8 This Clause 2 does not impact your statutory rights as a consumer, nor does it affect your
                        rights to cancel the contract.<br>
                        2.3 Servet Ege shall not be liable to pay any compensation for the infringement of any third

                        4.2 Prices are subject to change at any time<br>
                        4.3 Audio downloads ordered from the website will be sent out immediately via email. Please

                        4.4 You agree to pay any applicable surcharge on payments made by credit card.<br>
                        Unless otherwise stated, all amounts shown on our website are in UK Pounds. The currency and
                        amount will be displayed before you make your payment. We do not store your financial
                        information on our platform. Our third-party service provider, Stripe, will store your details
                        and will use these details for each successive billing period. We are not responsible for your
                        data with Stripe. If you have any concerns about your data, you should check the privacy policy
                        for Stripe here: <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy" class="href">Stripe Link</a><br>
                        <br>

                        <strong>5. REFUNDS</strong><br>
                        5.1 You will receive immediate notification in the event that an appointment needs to be changed
                        or cancelled, such as in the case of an emergency. In such circumstances, you will be provided
                        with a full refund, and efforts will be made to reschedule your appointment at the earliest
                        possible time.<br>
                        5.2 We have a 48-hour cancellation policy. We can accommodate flexibility up to 48 hours prior
                        to your session. Within this time frame, we will make every effort to fill your spot, allowing
                        for rescheduling. However, if the spot cannot be filled, the session must be paid for as
                        scheduled.<br>
                        5.3 If you arrive more than 10 minutes late for your session, there is a possibility that your
                        appointment may be cancelled, depending on the day’s schedule with other clients. In such cases,
                        the full fee will be charged. Hypnotherapy sessions are structured, and a delay of 10 minutes or
                        more may not provide sufficient time to complete a session.<br>
                        5.4 Refunds for products bought will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Our aim is for you
                        to be absolutely happy with your product. If for some reason you are not, please email us at
                        self-transformingbrain@gmail.com and we will make every effort to amend the situation.<br><br>

                        6.1 Applicable laws mandate that certain information or communications we send to you must be in
                        writing. By using our website, you agree that communication with us will primarily be
                        electronic. We will contact you via email or provide information by posting notices on our
                        website. For contractual purposes, you consent to this electronic means of communication, and
