                                unique blend of my passion for neuroscience and personal growth, with each experience
                                shaping my deep commitment to helping others to heal and transform. From a very young
                                age I worked, study and support my mother as we lived in poverty. I never knew my
                                father, and rightly so, as he made her life hell. My mother found out that my father was
                                already married and had four kids when I was born. She eventually divorced him, but it
                                took hell of long time because he refused to let her go, making sure that she suffered
                                emotionally and physically throughout the process. Her second marriage was also
                                difficult, filled with emotional and physical trauma as a result of domestic violence.
                                So, growing up in such an environment, I experienced emotional and physical trauma.
                                However, I was very bright kid, with dream of becoming a scientist. I always had A plus
                                grades in all my scientific subjects throughout secondary and high school, which gave me
                                a sense of purpose and hope. Despite the chaos at home, my academic success became a
                                refuge for me. At 17, I moved to the UK. Although I had originally planned to study
                                neuroscience, I ended up pursuing in Finance and Accounting. I have been working in
                                Finance industry for last 28 years in the city of London in range of senior roles in
                                private and public companies in corporate world. I have amazing and successful career in
                                Finance industry. Also, last five years I have been working as a Visiting Lecturer at
                                University of Westminster teaching range of subjects within Economy, Entrepreneurship,
                                Finance and Accounting, Business Management and Strategy, and Quantitative Analysis to
                                both undergraduates and postgraduates. I have actively contributed to both the education
                                and business sectors, focusing on roles in training and mentorship. As a
                                Research/Dissertation Supervisor and Project Supervisor, I assist learners—ranging from
                                students to young professionals and early-career workers—in enhancing their skills and
                                advancing their professional growth.

                            <p class="two">Through my work experiences and studies, I began to explore the human mind
                                and the brain’s remarkable ability to heal, with a fascination that eventually grew into
                                my passion for neuroscience. As the time passes, I became increasingly aware of how
                                deeply intertwined the mind and body are, and how past traumas can show up both
                                physically and emotionally in our lives. Over the years, I have developed a deep desire
                                to further understand the connections between mind and healing, not only for my own
                                personal growth and healing but also to help others. My own experiences with childhood
                                trauma, fuelled my commitment to supporting others in overcoming their struggles. I
                                wanted to be the kind of support and guide that I didn't always have when I was growing
                                up, someone who could help others to recognise their worth and potential, despite the
                                challenges they face. </p>

                                This journey led me to pursue a career in RTT Hypnotherapy, allowing me to combine my
                                passion for neuroscience with my personal experiences, while guiding others toward their
                                own healing and transformation. Through my training with Marisa Peer, the founder of
                                Rapid Transformational Therapy (RTT), I developed the skills to work with the
                                subconscious mind, helping individuals release limiting patterns formed by past
                                experiences, negative influences, and trauma. I am currently taking further steps in my
                                journey by pursuing an MSc in Neuroscience and the Psychology of Mental Health at the
                                University of Warwick. After completing my MSc, I plan to pursue a PhD in Neuroscience.
                                Thanks to a couple of RTT hypnotherapy sessions, I was able to release my childhood
                                traumas and unlock my childhood dream of becoming a <span
