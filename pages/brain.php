                                Regardless of age, location, or background, if you're determined to pursue your passion,
                                you will find a way. I am living proof of this. At 50, I am currently pursuing a second
                                master's degree to follow my lifelong passion of becoming a neuroscientist. My goal is
                                to ultimately balance two careers: one in finance and the other in neuroscience. This
                                journey has not only led me to a new career path but has also inspired me to become a
                                therapist and coach. Now, I guide and support others on their own life journeys, helping
                                them uncover their true potential and reconnect with who they truly are.<br><br>

                                With 28 years of experience working in finance across various business within the
                                corporate world, I have developed a strong foundation as an Intrapreneur, Business, and
                                Finance expert. Over the years, I have held diverse roles such as business advisor,
                                accountant, director, mentor, lecturer, and coach, working with students, young
                                professionals, and early-career workers to enhance their skills and foster professional
                                development.<br><br>

                                I possess a solid business and finance acumen, along with strong analytical skills,
                                especially when it comes to SMEs and large organizations. As a coach, my goal is to use
                                these skills, knowledge and experience to help you discover your strengths, set personal
                                and professional goals, and work on improving your confidence, motivation, leadership
                                skills, executive functioning, and self-esteem.<br><br>

                                I will guide you through the process of envisioning the future you want and support you
                                in making the changes necessary to achieve it, especially during challenging
                                transitions. Whether it’s leaving a toxic relationship, relocating for career
                                opportunities, or facing any major life decision, my coaching sessions will help you
                                gain clarity and confidence to navigate the changes ahead.<br><br>

                                Your brain constantly shapes how you perceive the world and yourself. It has the
                                remarkable ability to change and adapt through a process called <span

                                This process also enables you to a <span class="highlighted-text">Create New, Positive
                                    Self Image.</span> Self-image is the
                                mental picture you have of yourself, including how you view your abilities, appearance,
                                and worth. This image is often influenced by past experiences, beliefs, and societal
                                expectations. A positive self-image can lead to a more fulfilling and successful life,
                                while a negative self-image may hold you back from reaching your goals.<br><br>

                                <span class="highlighted-text">Brain and Self-Image Coaching</span> can be incredibly
                                beneficial for both women and students
                                in various ways, particularly for mental and emotional growth. Many women struggle with
                                self-esteem or feel pressure to meet societal expectations. My coaching can help them to
                                develop a positive self-image, set boundaries, and embrace their uniqueness. Students
                                often face stress, comparison, and a fear of failure. As a coach I can help them to
                                build their self-confidence, increase belief in their abilities, and combat negative
                                self-talk.<br><br>

                                Whether it’s career, family, or personal life, many women experience stress and anxiety.
                                <span class="highlighted-text">As a Brain and Self-Image Coach,</span> I provide tools
                                to manage stress, stay calm under
                                pressure, and approach challenges with a clear mind. Students often experience
                                heightened stress due to academic pressures, peer relationships, and future career
                                worries. As a coach I can teach relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and strategies for
                                balancing their life and studies.<br><br>

                                <span class="highlighted-text">As a Brain and Self-Image Coach,</span> I help women to
                                set clear, achievable goals in various
                                aspects of life, such as career, relationships, and personal growth. This helps them to
                                take actionable steps toward their dreams. I also assist students in setting academic
                                and personal goals, staying focused on them, and developing the discipline to succeed,
                                while ensuring they don’t feel overwhelmed.<br><br>

                                Life presents challenges, and women may sometimes feel discouraged by setbacks. <span

                                    Brain and Self-Image Coach,</span> I help women build emotional resilience so they
                                can bounce
                                back from adversity and view setbacks as valuable learning opportunities. Women, like
                                students, may face failure, rejection, or unexpected obstacles. As a coach, I guide them
                                in reframing negative experiences, teach effective coping strategies for
                                disappointments, and foster a growth mindset. Understanding and managing emotions is
                                vital for women, both personally and professionally. I teach emotional intelligence
                                skills that enhance relationships, communication, and decision-making process. For
                                students navigating the complexities of adolescence and early adulthood, emotional
                                intelligence plays a crucial role in improving social skills, resolving conflicts, and
                                managing emotions effectively in school and relationships. Women often juggle multiple
                                roles, including career, family, and self-care. As a Brain and Self-Image Coach, I can
                                help them prioritize their time, delegate tasks, and create a healthy balance between
                                work, personal life, and self-care. Similarly, students often struggle with balancing
                                study, extracurricular activities, and personal life.<br><br>

                                <span class="highlighted-text">As a Brain and Self-Image Coach,</span> I help
                                individuals reconnect with their true selves by
                                breaking free from their outdated beliefs and patterns. My mission is to guide
                                individuals to shedding the layers of their old self-images and discovering their
                                authentic purpose in life. Together, we will unlock your full potential, empowering you
                                to live a life that truly reflects who you are, not the expectations or limitations of
                                others.<br><br>

                                Brain and Self-Image coaching typically requires a minimum of three sessions. You can
                                schedule a 30-minute free consultation via Zoom. After the consultation, I will tailor a
                                coaching plan to meet your specific needs.

                                inspiration from trailblazers like Moriel Zelikowsky. Her groundbreaking contributions
                                to neuroscience, particularly in the areas of brain science and self-image, have not
                                only advanced our understanding of the brain but also empowered countless individuals to
                                embrace their potential for change and growth.
                                In this video, you’ll learn about Moriel’s remarkable journey and her passion for
                                reshaping how we think about the brain and self-perception and also mental health as a
                                whole. Her story is a powerful reminder that with resilience, dedication, and a
                                commitment to self-discovery, we can transform our self-image and unlock new
                                possibilities for personal and professional growth.
                                Moriel’s work resonates deeply with my own journey, as I strive to contribute to the
                                evolving field of neuroscience and help others tap into the transformative power of the
                                brain.
