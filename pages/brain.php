                                    Coach,</span> I offer a transformative
                                approach that blends neuroscience, Rapid Transformational Therapy, Hypnotherapy, life

                                helps individuals to shift their negative mindsets, able to break free from
                                self-limiting beliefs and fears and enhance their self-image to unlock the true
                                potential. Through the sessions, you’ll gain deep insights into how the brain operates
                                and shapes your self-image, thoughts, emotions, and behaviours. The brain is one of the
                                most complex and powerful organs that governs everything from breathing to thinking.
                                Therefore, it is important to understand its functions for both mental and physical
                                well-being of a person. <br><br>

                                foster their resilience and a positive mindset. Whether it’s managing stress, setting
                                goals, overcoming obstacles, or improving self-esteem, both women and students can
                                thrive with my professional guidance and support. I deeply understand the power of
                                personal growth and transformation from my own journey. I've always believed in the
                                importance of finding your passion in life. Regardless of age, location, or background,

                                passion of becoming a neuroscientist. My goal is to ultimately balance two careers: one
                                in finance and the other is in neuroscience. This journey has not only led me to a new
                                career path but has also inspired me to become a therapist and coach. Now, I am able to

                                With many years of experience in the corporate world, I have developed solid business
                                and financial acumen, along with strong analytical skills especially when it comes to
                                SMEs and large organizations. As a Brain Coach, my goal is to use these skills,

                </p>
                <p class="six">As I am currently studying to become a neuroscientist, I draw immense inspiration from trailblazers like Dr Moriel Zelikowsky. Dr Zelikowsky’s groundbreaking contributions to neuroscience, particularly in the areas of brain science and self-image it has not only advanced our understanding of the brain but also empowered countless individuals to embrace their potential for change and growth. In this video, you’ll learn about Dr Moriel’s remarkable journey and her passion for reshaping how we think about the brain and the human’s self-perception along with our mental health. Overall, Dr. Zelikowsky’s story is a powerful reminder that with strong resilience, dedication, and a commitment to self-discovery, we can transform our self-image with ease and able to unlock new possibilities for both personal and professional growth. Dr Moriel’s work resonates deeply with my own journey, as I strive to contribute to the evolving field of neuroscience and help others to tap into the transformative power of their own brain.
